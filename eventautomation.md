# Event Automation Experience

## Introduction
In this lab you will explorer key capabilities using **IBM Event Automation**, a platform built on Apache Kafka and Flink that allows you to build event-driven applications and microservices, enabling you to ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of event data in real-time.
To help you start exploring the features of IBM Event Automation, the tutorial includes a small selection of topics with a live stream of events that are ready to use.

The tutorial topics simulate aspects of a clothing retailer, with topics relating to sales, stock management, and employee activities. Messages on the topics are consistent (for example, events on the topic for cancelled orders use order IDs that are used in events on the orders topic) to allow you to experiment with joining and correlating events from different topics. Some topics include events that are intentionally delayed, duplicated, or produced out of sequence, to allow you to learn how to use Event Automation to correctly process topics like this.
