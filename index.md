Welcome to IBM Application Modernization Worskhop: in this session you will experience an IBM Proof of Technology.

**What is a Proof of Technology?**

IBM Proof of Technology sessions are complimentary classes to build
understanding of IBM technology and software with practical
presentations and hands-on lab exercises. 

We will cover all the various components that are part of Cloud Pak for Integration. We will also discuss how these components can be used in combination.

*  **IBM App Connect Enterprise**
*  **IBM API Connect**
*  **IBM Event Automation**
*  **IBM MQ Advanced**


**Cloud Pak for Integration is IBM’s hybrid integration platform (HIP) that helps to solve**
- Complexity of integration. Integrating where apps and data that now live in hybrid landscapes including on-prem, and multiple clouds
- Need for speed. Agility in development, architecture, and operations aspects of integration
- Developer sharing and re-use of integration assets
- Unification of integration broad ranging integration technologies – e.g. iPaaS, API management, messaging, events
- Easily portable to other clouds, since this can run on RedHat OpenShift. This allows you to install and operate the Pak identically across multiple cloud vendors.

|  Topic                                | Description                                                                
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [API Management Experiences](APIC-labs/ReadMe.md)          | This section you will explore an API Management platform for use in your API Economy. IBM API Connect (APIC) enables users to create, assemble, manage, secure and socialize APIs.  
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|   
| [Integration Experiences](Integration/index.md)         | This section you will explorer key capabilities using IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) to build integrations solutions.  When creating APIs you will also import them into IBM API Connect.
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|     
| [Event Automation Experiences](eventautomation.md)          | This section you will explore Event Automation solution, a platform built on Apache Kafka and Flink that allows you to build event-driven applications and microservices, enabling you to ingest, process, and analyze large volumes of event data in real-time.
